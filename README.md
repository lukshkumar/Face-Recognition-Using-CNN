# Face-Recognition-Using-CNN

This is a course project for CS495 (Fundamentals of Computer Vision) and is based on the idea of recognizing the human faces in a crowd. The project is build by maneuvering the feature vector extracted from YOLO v2 face detection and passing it to face recognition module build on dlib.


## Objective
The aim of this project was to implement crowd based face recognition using convolutional neural network. In the process of discovering several libraries and architectures, we increased the accuracy of dlib face recognition by maneuvering several feature vectors by incorporating it with YOLO v3.
